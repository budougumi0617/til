## Memo

```bash
Success! Created nextjs-dashboard at /Users/budougumi0617/go/src/github.com/budougumi0617/til/react/nextjs-dashboard
Inside that directory, you can run several commands:

  pnpm run dev
    Starts the development server.

  pnpm run build
    Builds the app for production.

  pnpm start
    Runs the built app in production mode.

We suggest that you begin by typing:

  cd nextjs-dashboard
  pnpm run dev
```
